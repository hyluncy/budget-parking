# Budget Parking

> [!NOTE] 
> Current Status: Ongoing / On Hold

## Purpose
An application where you can locate a Green P lot based on the cost of parking. 

## Why It's Important
Created to assist users in planning a trip out to Toronto while on a budget. 

## Current Progress
On hold 

This app was created to figure out how to incorporate Google Maps API into a web application, the use of Python scripts to manipulate/change data. The design/structure of the app will need to be recreated to ensure the backend/frontend do not clash. The goal would be to create a well-thought-out full-stack application. 


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
